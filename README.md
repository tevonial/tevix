# tevix
A hobbyist x86 kernel based on the articles from [OSDev.org](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
Some code is borrowed from [bkerndev](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm) and  [BrokenThorn](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html).

Tevix is still and will probably always be a work in progress.  Right now the priority is to implement some solid memory managment.
