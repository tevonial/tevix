# tevix
A hobbyist x86 kernel based on the articles and forums at [OSDev.org](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
Some code is borrowed from [bkerndev](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm),   [BrokenThorn](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html), and [JamesM](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html).

Tevix is still and will probably always be a work in progress.  Right now the priority is to:
* ~~implement some solid memory managment~~
* implement some solid task switching
* implement disk drivers
* implement ELF loader
